# Redis resiliency toolkit

Understand, validate & demonstrate Redis fault tolerance.

# TL;DR

You're probably using [redis](https://github.com/redis/redis). You probably don't fully understand its failure scenarios.

This repo attemps two things:

1. teach you about Redis failure scenarios
2. provide a tool for implementing failure testing scenarios at home (Chaos Engineering)


**Note**: I have no affiliation with Redis Ltd, I'm merely a concerned citizen seeing bad usage in the wild.
